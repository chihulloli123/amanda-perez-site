    Jordan Davenport, a proud member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, was told he could not wear his tribal regalia
    for his senior yearbook portrait. Oklahoma Title 70 Â§24-160 protects Native studentsâ€™ right to wear regalia during
    school events and ceremonies. This page documents that story and encourages cultural respect.
