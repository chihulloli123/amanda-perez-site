  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Relearning the Foundations</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Posted: <span id="date"></span></p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Every high-performing organization has one thing in common: strong fundamentals.  
    Whether you’re running a company, managing a team, or building technology — your decisions are only as good as the data behind them.  
    This week, I’m revisiting the foundational tools that power modern operations and intelligent decision-making:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li>Excel lookups (VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, Index/Match)</li>
    <li>Excel macros & automation</li>
    <li>Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)</li>
    <li>SQL for structured data extraction</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    These aren’t “beginner tools.” They’re core instruments used every day across Fortune 500 analytics teams, finance departments, logistics hubs, and enterprise reporting systems.  
    Relearning them isn’t about going backwards — it’s about strengthening the base that everything else sits on.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Excel Lookups: The First Layer of Insight</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Lookups are the fastest way to transform raw information into actionable data.  
    They enable matching, merging, and verifying information without manual review — critical in environments where accuracy and speed matter.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Macros & VBA: Automating Operational Burden</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Any executive knows the real cost inside an organization isn’t the one-time task — it’s the tasks repeated thousands of times.  
    Macros turn repeatable processes into automated workflows, eliminating human error and unlocking hours of productivity.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    VBA is the logic that powers those macros. It’s not glamorous, but it is effective.  
    Years ago, I used VBA to automatically create individual data sheets for every associate in a large dataset — a task that would have taken hours by hand. Code did it in seconds.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">SQL: Precision Data Extraction</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    SQL is where data stops being static and becomes strategic.  
    It’s the foundation of enterprise reporting, compliance checks, financial forecasting, customer analytics — everything that keeps a large business moving.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    I explained it to a friend recently using an example he’d recognize:<br><br>

    “Imagine you work at a major logistics hub — something on the scale of a FedEx facility in Dallas–Fort Worth.  
    Now imagine needing to pull every order that 
    <img

      alt="Operator Example"
      class="w-32 h-32 rounded-full border-2 border-gray-300 mx-2 align-middle shadow-md object-cover"
    />
    has handled over the past two years.<br><br>

    If you attempted it manually, you’d be reviewing thousands of records across different shifts, managers, and systems.  
    SQL retrieves it instantly — clean, filtered, and ready for analysis.”
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    That’s the power of fundamentals: Excel handles exploration, VBA automates the repetitive tasks, and SQL delivers precision at scale.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-10 font-semibold">
    Strong companies are built on strong systems.  
    Strong systems are built on strong fundamentals.  
    This week is about sharpening those fundamentals — so every layer above them stays solid.
